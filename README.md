# BoardGameGeek Database Builder

Welcome to the **BoardGameGeek Database Builder** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that allows you to extract and compile data from the [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) (BGG) website. This tool is perfect for board game enthusiasts looking to build a personalized database of games, which can then be queried for specific types of games based on your preferences.

## Project Overview

This project is centered around a Python script embedded in a Jupyter Notebook that scrapes data from BGG. The script extracts key information about board games, such as the title, publication year, average rating, number of plays, recommended player counts, mechanics, and even Amazon pricing.

The database generated by this script is stored in a pandas DataFrame, which can be exported to CSV or Excel files for further analysis. Whether you're a board game collector, a developer looking to build a recommendation engine, or just someone who loves data, this tool can help you organize and explore board game information like never before.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extract detailed data from individual BGG pages.
- **Data Storage**: Save the extracted data in a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
- **Amazon Price Integration**: Check the current Amazon price for the games.
- **Custom Queries**: Query the database for specific game attributes such as player count, mechanics, or ranking.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several Python libraries, including:

- `requests`: For sending HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content.
- `pandas`: For storing and manipulating the game data.
- `re`: For regular expressions used in data extraction.
- `json`: For parsing JSON data.

## Usage

Inside the notebook, you'll find the code necessary to scrape data from BGG, store it in a DataFrame, and perform custom queries.

### Example Functions

Here are some of the key functions used in the project:

```python
def fetch_page_content(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}):
    # Fetches the HTML content of a webpage.
    ...

def parse_html(html_content):
    # Parses HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
    ...

def extract_game_data(soup, url, rank):
    # Extracts game data from the parsed HTML and returns a dictionary.
    ...
```

### Running the Script

To scrape data and populate your database, run the cells in the notebook sequentially. The script will print status updates and inform you if a URL has already been processed.

## Example Queries

Once you have your database built, you can perform various queries to find games that match specific criteria, such as:

- **Finding games for 2 players with a high average rating**:
  ```python
  two_player_games = games_data_df[(games_data_df['PCountRecomm_min'] <= 2) & (games_data_df['PCountRecomm_max'] >= 2)]
  top_rated_games = two_player_games[two_player_games['AveRating'] > 8.0]
  ```

- **Listing games that use a specific mechanic (e.g., "Deck Building")**:
  ```python
  deck_building_games = games_data_df[games_data_df['Mechanics'].str.contains('Deck Building')]
  ```

## Data Files

The repository also contains additional files such as:

- **CSV Files**: Exported versions of the game database.
- **Excel Files**: For easier data manipulation and sharing.

These files are stored in the `data/` directory.
